# GRKit

For RICOH GR III and GR III HDF firmware 2.10 only.

## Install

1. Turn the camera off.
2. Copy the contents of `SD_ROOT` to the root of the SD card.
3. Insert the card. Hold MENU while you turn the camera on. Wait until the camera turns itself off.
4. Turn the camera on normally.

Step 3 turns on the camera's SD scripts. The camera shows Mode Set Command, then Complete, and then turns itself off.

If the SD scripts are already on, skip step 3.
After the installation, you can remove `00078350.588` and `DEVELOP.MOD` from the card root. This step is optional.

## Use

Open ADJ and select the sixth entry, GRK. GRKit loads a few seconds after power-on, so the entry can appear late.

- **Image Control:** highlight an effect to preview it. Press OK to keep it. Press Fn to adjust the Standard parameters of the effect. On the GRK menu, press Fn on the Image Control row to adjust the selected effect. Each effect keeps its own adjustments, and they do not change the camera's Image Control settings.
- **Framing:** select XPan, 16:9, or 4:3. The viewfinder dims the area outside the photo. Framing works only with the native 3:2 aspect ratio.
- **Guides:** select a guide style. The lines show only in the viewfinder.
- **Date Stamp:** select a date style. Photos get the date at the bottom right.
- **Grain:** select Weak, Medium, or Strong. Only photos get the grain.

Highlight the last row, GRK, to see the GRKit version.

Press MENU to go back one level. GRKit keeps your settings after power-off.

## Remove or recover

To remove GRKit, turn the camera off. Then delete the `SCRIPT` folder from the card.

The SD script setting stays on. To turn it off:

1. On https://grkit.app, download the files that turn SD scripts off for your camera. The button is below the installation steps.
2. Copy the contents of `SD_ROOT` to the root of the SD card.
3. Insert the card. Hold MENU while you turn the camera on. Wait until the camera turns itself off.
4. Remove `00078350.588` and `DEVELOP.MOD` from the card root.

If the camera stops during startup, remove the battery and the card. Then start the camera without the card. If it still does not start, see the [recovery guide](https://github.com/ahonn/grkit/blob/main/resources/RECOVERY.md).
